Another exciting aspect is its requirement to keep learning and to keep up-to-date with the latest tools as technilogy progresses exponentially.

			<p> Extracurriculars include organizing a "Wizarding 5k and Festival" to raise funds for childhood education in our community and abroad by inviting coporations to establish team-building experiences with their staff, while networking and advertisement to the general public who will also be part of the event. My non- profit organization; The Traveling Unicorn (for childhood education abroad) has parnetered up with the West Orlando Rotary Club, the Central Florida Slug Club (Harry Potter fan club), and Charisma's Crayons (for childhood education in Orlando) to bring the Orlando community an extremely fun event for all.
